In addition, as my knowledge and experience will (hopefully) grow over time, some of the older information presented on this website may no longer reflect my views and opinions at the given moment. As a rule, I will not delete any content and I will not update the information to follow my actual views. Any changes will be made only to correct obvious mistakes (e.g. spelling or grammar) or to clarify/extend the material. If my opinion on some matter will change dramatically and I will feel the need to spread the word about it, it will be done by adding new content (post) to the website, not by correcting the historical material. I will keep the changes to the website transparent by keeping the source of the blog on [GitHub](https://github.com) as a [GitHub Page](https://pages.github.com/) under [sgulinski.github.io](https://github.com/sgulinski/sgulinski.github.io) repository.
