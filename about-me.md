I am a Software Engineer and Technical Leader based in Warsaw, Poland. My passion for computers and technology started when I was only seven years old and got my first home PC. After finishing heavily math-oriented high school and graduating with master’s degree in computer science, I got my first job as a programmer and never looked back. Since the beginning of my professional career in 2009, I work in a consulting business, serving clients from the financial services industry. Strictly speaking, I am involved in delivering tailor-made back-office software for the banking sector and my core technology stack has always consisted of the MS .NET Framework (C#) and MS SQL Server (native, non-ORM T-SQL). Most of the solutions I worked on use ASP .NET for front-end, but I have always been closer to the back-end, thus have minimal experience in creating UIs.

What distinguishes me from most of the software engineers and in general most of the people involved in “hard” science are my highly developed soft skills. I believe that this, combined with technical experience, was my biggest asset that helped me in moving from regular Software Engineer position to my current role of a Team Leader. During this transition, my responsibilities have been greatly extended. Right now, besides programming tasks and taking care of the overall design of the software, I need to ensure that right, motivated people are involved in the right process and that using the best tools available they will deliver the right solution. There is a lot of “right” involved and figuring out what exactly do they mean under actual circumstances is part of my role. By no means it is easy. To answer these questions I invest significant part of my professional life in researching topics related to: hiring, motivating and developing the best programmers; delivering clean, testable and reusable code; software development and delivery methodologies. I also try to keep myself up to date with the available tools helping in the aforementioned areas.

Working in the FSI industry, I have also developed deep interest in financial markets, financial engineering, credit and market risks and almost everything related to the big Wall Street institutions and their trading activities. I don’t have any formal education in these areas and my job does not always allow me to explore them in detail, so diving deep into these topics takes significant part of my free time.
