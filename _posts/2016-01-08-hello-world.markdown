As you can read in <a href="{{ "/about-me" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">About Me</a> section, I am a Software Engineer and Technical Leader based in Warsaw, Poland and since 2009 I work in a consulting business, serving clients from the Financial Services Industry. 

I was thinking about the idea of starting a blog for more than a year now and I believe that this is the moment when I can start bringing something valuable to the community, hence this website. I will share my views and thoughts on topics that are close to my professional interests. It will be a technical website and most of the content here will be related to programming, various aspects of software development, building effective teams and great engineering cultures. I guess that from time to time I might write something related to the financial markets, but that should be it. If you decide to stay with me, I promise not to bother you with details of my private life or with anything not related to technology or finance.
